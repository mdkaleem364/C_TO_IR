// TODO

1. braces after for loop will make it compound stmt. else nrml stmt. we handled only one case.

2. print stmt functions call in printf()- ‘$i’

3. -b in printf('%d %d', a, -b)

4. for loops initializations

5. arrays - ‘a[i] = j’ => assign a i j

6. pointers – same as arrays

7. int a = max(i, j); (omkar)

8. check assignments stmts in binary ops:
	for(;i<3 && (i=0);)

a = max(i, j); --- rcall max a i j 
max(i, j); call max i j
reset(a); --- call reset a 

a = i + j;
a[i] = j;
